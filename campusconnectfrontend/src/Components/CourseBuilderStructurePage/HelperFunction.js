        <h2>Welcome to the Course!</h2>
        <p>This course will provide a comprehensive overview of artificial intelligence (AI), laying the groundwork for more 
        advanced topics that will be covered later. AI is a broad and fast-evolving field that impacts various aspects of 
        modern life. From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced applications in healthcare and finance, AI is 
        everywhere. In this introductory section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of AI, its history, and its potential 
        future.</p>

        <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act 
        like humans. The concept of AI encompasses a range of technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically 
        require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into three types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Also known as weak AI, this type is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial 
          recognition or internet searches. Narrow AI is currently the most common form of AI.</li>
          <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Also known as strong AI, this type aims to be as intelligent as a human across all tasks. 
          General AI remains largely theoretical at this stage.</li>
          <li><strong>Superintelligent AI:</strong> This hypothetical form of AI surpasses human intelligence and could potentially 
          outperform humans in every aspect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The History of AI</h3>
        <p>AI has its roots in the mid-20th century when mathematicians and scientists began exploring the possibility of creating 
        machines that could think. Key milestones include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1950:</strong> Alan Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Test to evaluate a machine's ability to exhibit 
          intelligent behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>1956:</strong> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy during the Dartmouth Conference, 
          which is considered the birthplace of AI as a field of study.</li>
          <li><strong>1980s:</strong> The rise of expert systems, which were AI programs designed to simulate the decision-making 
          ability of a human expert.</li>
          <li><strong>2000s-Present:</strong> The advent of machine learning, big data, and deep learning has propelled AI to new 
          heights, leading to advancements in fields like natural language processing and computer vision.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Applications of AI</h3>
        <p>AI is being used in various industries to enhance efficiency, improve decision-making, and create new opportunities. 
        Some key applications include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> AI is used for diagnostic purposes, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Finance:</strong> AI powers algorithmic trading, fraud detection, and personalized financial advice.</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> AI is integral to the development of autonomous vehicles and traffic management 
          systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Retail:</strong> AI enhances customer experiences through personalized recommendations and inventory 
          management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As we delve into the more technical aspects of AI in the following sections, it is important to keep these foundational 
        concepts in mind. This will provide context and help you understand the broader implications of the technology as it continues 
        to evolve.</p>`,

        <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act 
        like humans. The concept of AI encompasses a range of technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically 
        require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into three types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Also known as weak AI, this type is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial 
          recognition or internet searches. Narrow AI is currently the most common form of AI.</li>
          <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Also known as strong AI, this type aims to be as intelligent as a human across all tasks. 
          General AI remains largely theoretical at this stage.</li>
          <li><strong>Superintelligent AI:</strong> This hypothetical form of AI surpasses human intelligence and could potentially 
          outperform humans in every aspect.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The History of AI</h3>
        <p>AI has its roots in the mid-20th century when mathematicians and scientists began exploring the possibility of creating 
        machines that could think. Key milestones include:</p>
        <ul>

        <h2>Deep Learning: A Subset of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that leverages neural networks with multiple layers, also known 
        as deep neural networks. These layers allow the model to learn complex patterns in data, making deep learning particularly 
        effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even playing strategic games like 
        chess and Go. In this document, we'll explore the intricacies of deep learning, including its architecture, training methods, 
        challenges, and real-world applications.</p>

        <h3>Architecture of Deep Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>A deep neural network consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron in a layer 
        receives input, applies a weight, and passes the result through an activation function before sending it to the next layer. 
        The depth of the network, or the number of hidden layers, allows the model to capture more abstract representations of the 
        input data.</p>

        <h4>Key Components of Deep Neural Networks:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Primarily used for image processing, CNNs apply convolutional 
          filters to detect features such as edges, textures, and shapes in images.</li>
          <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Designed for sequential data, RNNs are commonly used in time-series 
          forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</li>
          <li><strong>Autoencoders:</strong> These are unsupervised learning models used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, 
          denoising, and anomaly detection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Training Deep Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>Training a deep neural network involves feeding data into the model, calculating the error between the predicted output 
        and the actual target, and adjusting the model's weights to minimize this error. This process is typically done using 
        backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.</p>

        <h4>Challenges in Training:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data, it is said to 
          overfit. Regularization techniques and dropout layers are commonly used to mitigate this issue.</li>
          <li><strong>Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:</strong> In very deep networks, gradients can become too small (vanishing) 
          or too large (exploding), making it difficult to train the model effectively. Solutions include using advanced 
          architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for RNNs or adjusting the learning rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Computational Resources:</strong> Deep learning models require substantial computational power and time 
          to train, especially with large datasets. Utilizing GPUs and cloud computing resources can help alleviate this 
          challenge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-World Applications of Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>Deep learning has led to significant advancements in various fields, enabling technologies that were once considered 
        science fiction. Some notable applications include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Deep learning is used in medical imaging to detect diseases such as cancer, 
          analyze X-rays, and segment organs for surgery planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Self-driving cars use deep learning to recognize and respond to traffic 
          signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles in real time.</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Deep learning models power applications like chatbots, 
          language translation, and sentiment analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify use deep learning to personalize 
          content recommendations based on user preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you explore deep learning further, consider how these principles can be applied to your own projects. Whether 
        you're developing a new application, improving an existing system, or conducting research, deep learning offers powerful 
        tools to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.</p>`,
